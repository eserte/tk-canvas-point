Tk::Canvas::Point
-----------------

This module introduces a new canvas item type: points. This is nothing
useful, as points may be expressed as lines in the Canvas
implementation. It's merely a small educational example.

0.03 was tested on FreeBSD-6.1 with various Perl and Tk combinations
(e.g. perl5.8.8+Tk804.027_500).

0.02 was tested with FreeBSD-4.6+perl-5.8.0+Tk-800.024,
FreeBSD-4.9+perl-5.8.3+Tk-804.027 and
Linux-2.2.x+perl-5.00503+Tk-800.xxx. It won't work with cygwin; it
compiles, but the linker complains about unresolved symbols.


INSTALLATION
------------

With modern CPAN.pm:

	cpan .

The old-fashioned way:

	perl Makefile.PL
	make all test install
