Tk::Canvas::Point
-----------------

This module introduces a new canvas item type: points. This is nothing
useful, as points may be expressed as lines in the Canvas
implementation. It's merely a small educational example.

This module works on FreeBSD and Linux (tested:
FreeBSD-4.6+perl-5.8.0+Tk-800.024, FreeBSD-4.9+perl-5.8.3+Tk-804.027
and Linux-2.2.x+perl-5.00503+Tk-800.xxx). It won't work with cygwin;
it compiles, but the linker complains about unresolved symbols.


INSTALLATION
------------

	perl Makefile.PL
	make all test install
